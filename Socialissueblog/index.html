<h1>What are Social Issues?</h1>
<div class="head5">


<h3>
  A social issue is a problem that influences many citizens within a society.
  It is a common problem in present-day society and one that many people strive to solve.
  It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control.
  Social issues are the source of a conflicting opinion on the grounds of what is perceived
  as morally correct or incorrect personal life or interpersonal social life decisions.
  In simple words,it means a social problem is any condition or behavior that has negative
  consequences for large numbers of people.

    <h1>My Suggestion of Tackling Social Issues</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>As,every social problem is caused by multiple factors,
        but it is always possible to find out the chief factor, <br>
         the cooperative factors and the minor aggravates
        in the origin and development of the problem.</li>
          <br>
        <li>

 Many a times, the nature of the social problem is such that the control becomes extremely difficult, <br>
  if not impossible. This happens when a social problem is occa­sioned by natural factors like droughts <br>
  or floods or when the conflict of social interests blocks the application of curative programmes, <br>
   or a revo­lution is needed to change the existing political or economic systems.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
Once after understanding and judging social problems,
the society has to be effective and  has <br>
 to take action whether it is by attempting
to change the current social institutions or by trying to <br>
alleviate them by adopting
measures without trying to change the existing institutions.
        </li>
